# Project Status

Status: `in_progress`
Current phase: `Phase 03 - Browsing MVP`
Last updated: `2026-05-05`

## Product Summary

Build a React Native client for TubeArchivist with its own identity and design language.
The MVP targets `Android` and `Android TV`, prioritizes `Continue Watching`, hides `Shorts`, and favors intentional browsing over engagement-driven discovery.

## Current Focus

- Start Phase 03 browsing implementation on top of completed Phase 02 foundation work
- Build sectionless home browsing feed with `Continue Watching` priority
- Define and implement mobile-targeted browsing specs alongside Android TV parity
- Add mobile card affordances for intentional retrieval (`progress-on-thumbnail` and `New` chips)
- Remove in-screen tab titles/subtitles; use active tab highlight as section indicator

## Active Constraints

- App code must live in `/app`
- Tracking must live at repo root
- Primary deployment context is self-hosted, usually local network
- MVP auth is manual `API token` entry
- One saved server is the default assumption

## Known Risks

- TubeArchivist media playback may behave differently from JSON API auth
- Local-network HTTP/self-signed setups may introduce Android networking issues
- Android TV focus quality can regress if not validated continuously
- TubeArchivist API is usable but not a stable third-party contract

## Foundation Outcomes (Phase 02)

- Resume source in-app is read from `/api/video/<video_id>/` metadata, not from `GET /api/video/<video_id>/progress/` in the current environment.
- Progress persistence is validated via `POST /api/video/<video_id>/progress/` and confirmed visible in the TubeArchivist UI.
- `react-native-video` v7 remains the baseline playback integration direction for this repository/runtime.
- App root orchestration was reduced and playback/connection concerns were extracted into focused modules.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Stabilize Home growable list behavior (20-item pages, manual load-more, smooth scroll)
2. Keep Home feed sectionless and compact while preserving Continue Watching priority
3. Add channels/playlists/search browsing surfaces incrementally with Android phone fluency checks and Android TV focus checks
